                    <h3>introduction&mdash;</h3>
                    <p class= "project-summary">
                        For an Information Systems class, we were asked to redesign and reimagine the website of Prantl's Bakery. <a href="prantlsbakery.com">Prantl's Bakery</a>, located in Pittsburgh, PA, is known for it delicious burnt almond torte. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>original design&mdash;</h3>
                    <p class="project-summary">
                        <img src="imgs/Prantls/prantlsog.png"/>
                        <br/><br/>
                        The website's current design is very confusing. The placement of information and visual flow across the website are not consistent and is quite difficult to navigate.
                    </p>
                    <h3>user stories&mdash;</h3>
                    <p class="project-summary">
                        Before beginning, I create a list of 10 user stories to better understand the purpose of the site and user needs. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>design process&mdash;</h3>
                    <p class="project-summary">
                        Before I began to design my website, I spent sometime navigating the website to condense and reorganize the information into a few pages. Instead of having so many pages, I decided to condense the website down into 4: the home page (doubles as an about page), the menu, store information, and contact information. I decide to streamline the catering information to go under the menu and also wanted to organize the menu by tabs. I felt that this simplified the system and made it more accessible. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        On the home page, I decided to focus on the things that I felt represented Prantl’s the best: the almond torte and general bakery background information. I thought that supplementing the information with extra images would help reinforce the message. Next, I wanted to create a “visit us” page that would incorporate the store information. This page would include information about both stores in a 2 column format. Lastly, the contact page would be a simple form that a visitor could fill out for more information. In the footer, I added social media links to help a user get better connected with the bakery. As for the navbar, I decided to have a fixed navbar that would be at the top of the page at all times. I think that this makes it easier for the user to access. Next, I tried to pick light complementary colors for the site because I felt that this suited the brand better.

                        <br/><br/>
                        I created a site map to help with visualizing and understanding information flow on the site. I also sketched different ideas I had for the website.

                       I conducted usability tests with 5 individuals. Before the testing sessions, I wrote out a script of the tasks and questions that I would ask them. During testing, I asked them for their initial impressions of the site and for them to complete a series of tasks encompassing all the features of the site. Then after completing the tasks, I would ask them what they liked and disliked about the site and what they would change.
