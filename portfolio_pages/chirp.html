                                    Within the health sector, nursing facilities are an underserved part of the population.

                                    Approximately 20 percent of all nursing home residents have major depression (about 350,000 people in the U.S.) and an additional 30 percent have significant depressive symptoms. 35% of residents state that they suffer from loneliness, and the risk for mortality is significantly higher for this group of residents. While nursing homes undergo a health inspection process (held by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) every quarter, none of the measurements are directly related to the mental health of the residents.

                                            Even in well maintained, profitable nursing homes, much of record keeping is still done on paper. Most nursing homes use a mix of paper records, spreadsheets, and healthcare software systems (such as Epic) to keep track of data.

                                            Social workers conduct checks in nursing homes to ensure that they are meeting standards because it is an often neglected area of the healthcare system. It is the one of the most regulated industries.

                                            Activities and volunteers are extremely important to nursing homes. Without the psycho-social stimulation, residents are less likely to be healthy and happy. Nursing home staff that we spoke to mentioned that "residents love to see new faces."

                                            Volunteers and care givers are the residents' primary forms of social interaction. Finding ways to bring people in to socialize with residents was a potential area that we could explore.

                                            The other area that we could address is regulation. Since negligence is far from uncommon in nursing homes, we decided that the second focus area was finding areas in the system to introduce accountability.

                                    Currently, volunteers are the major source of social interaction at nursing homes. They provide valuable interaction and mental stimulation to residents, which makes residents less likely to suffer from cognitive impairment. Even thought this seems like an easy solution, it is far from an effective one, as most nursing homes already have volunteer programs. From a volunteer's perspective, it is difficult to properly engage with the residents, and a structured way to meet and interact is currently lacking. Volunteers receieve litle to no guidance before they arrive for their session. The benefits that volunteers can bring to nursing home residents are significantly limited due to the lack of direct connection and direction.

                                    Chirp provides a way for volunteers, residents, and staff to engage more easily. Volunteers and residents can get to know each other better, and staff can help foster these social interactions. Using similar psychological theories behind social connection applications, Chirp encourages more social interaction and provides opportunities for the residents to connect with people. Our solution gives both volunteers and residents a chance to express their interests and gives them the power to initiate a conversation or activity.

                                    Residents and volunteers each have their own profiles with information such as interests, answers to icebreaker questions, a biography, and other details about themselves. Both residents and volunteers can view various user profiles and match with each other based on these profiles.

                                    This project started out as a very nebulous challenge, as no one in the team had any expertise in the medical field. With the help of professors, mentors, and the staff of nursing homes, we were able to get some insight into an often neglected space in the healthcare industry. Because the American healthcare industry is so profit driven, many people are left behind in the system. If given more time, we would have liked to make a prototype of the application and test it with nursing home residents and volunteers.
