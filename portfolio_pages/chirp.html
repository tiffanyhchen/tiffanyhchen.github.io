                                Within the health sector, nursing facilities are an underserved part of the population. In nursing homes, many residents feel lonely, depressed, and isolated, due to a lack of social interaction with other people. The team designed an application to address social isolation and mitigate mental health issues for residents.

                                Approximately 20 percent of all nursing home residents have major depression (about 350,000 people in the U.S.) and an additional 30 percent have significant depressive symptoms. Additionally, 35% of residents state that they suffer from loneliness, and the risk for mortality is significantly higher for this group of residents. While nursing homes undergo a health inspection process (held by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) every quarter, none of the measurements are directly related to the mental health of the residents.

                                Currently, volunteers are the major source of social interaction at nursing homes. They provide valuable interaction and mental stimulation to residents, which makes residents less likely to suffer from cognitive impairment. Even thought this seems like an easy solution, it is far from an effective one, as most nursing homes already have volunteer programs. From a volunteer's perspective, it is difficult to properly engage with the residents, and a structured way to meet and interact is currently lacking. Volunteers receieve litle to no guidance before they arrive for their session. The benefits that volunteers can bring to nursing home residents are significantly limited due to the lack of direct connection and direction.

                                Chirp provides a way for volunteers to engage with residents more easily and get to know them better. Residents and volunteers would each have their own profiles with information such as interests, answers to icebreaker questions, a biography, and other details about themselves. Both residents (with or without the help of staff members) and volunteers can view various user profiles and match with each other based on these profiles. If both of them match with each other, then a staff member can approve the match and schedule a meeting time. In the case that a specific resident needs more social interaction, a staff member can request for a match from a volunteer. Certain matches can be used to create open events, allowing all residents to participate and receive social stimulation.

                            <p class="main-paragraph">
                                We were inspired by other social connection applications such as Tinder, Coffee Meets Bagel, and Friended. Using similar psychological theories behind those applications, Chirp encourages more social interaction and provides opportunities for the residents to connect with people. Our solution gives both volunteers and residents a chance to express their interests and gives them the power to initiate a conversation or activity.
