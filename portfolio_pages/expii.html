                                    Expii is a free personalized learning website designed to simulate one-on-one tutoring experiences. The platform uses crowd sourcing and expert input to teach users (primarily middle school and high school students) math and science. I worked as a product design intern at Expii from September 2018 – April 2019. While I was there, I focused on <span class="font-bold">Topic Visualization and Dashboards</span>.

                                    When I joined, Expii did not have much of a dashboard for users to resume learning. Upon logging in, students would just see where they left over.

                                    Based on evaluations and discussions with my mentor and the CEO, we decided that a dashboard, or a way for students to visualize progress would be the focus of my work. The new dashboard would:

                                    Before jumping into designing, I conducted competitive analysis on other e-learning platforms, websites, and games.  In this process, I examined each platform's learning model and user interface. Some of the platforms I looked at included: Khan Academy, Albert, Hackerrank, Headspace, Duolingo, Coursera, etc.

                                    I focused mostly on the dashboards to see how each attempted to motivate users to return. In particular, I was most interested in learning about how certain platforms handled the concept of mastery.

                                    Using data gathered from competitive analysis, I worked with my mentor to construct an affinity diagram.

                                    The goal of constructing this diagram was to find common themes in educational dashboard design. This process helped us decide what to focus on and what other education platforms lacked.

                                        Unlike other platforms, Expii uses a ranking system and does not have a completion factor like most educational platforms do. This means that instead of motivating students to move towards completion, we have to motivate students towards mastery. 
                                    </p>

                                        <span class="font-bold">Ranking System</span><br/>
                                        Expii's ranking system works similarly to that of gaming platforms. Depending on performance, users can move up or down in rank. Only a small handful of education technology platforms use this approach.
                                    </p>

                                        Because the system is based on ranks, competition becomes a primary driving factor for improvement and growth. 
                                    </p>

                                        Badges, point systems, and progress indicators were common in many platforms. Being able to visualize progress is incredibly important to motivated self-learning.

As changes on other parts of the design happened, would go back to drawing board to see re-adjust the design.

                                        One of the features we wanted to have on the dashboard was allowing users to resume progress easily. With a single click, users should be able to pick up where they left off.

                                        The dashboard now shows progress bars that indicate a users progress towards a rank. In addition, we also wanted to show user progress on practice in a way such that they can target specific topics.
