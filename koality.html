                        Research has shown that phone use during social gatherings lowers the quality of social interaction and conversation. “Koality Time” is a mobile application that seeks to solve this problem by reducing phone use during hangouts. Users are incentivized with points that are earned during phone-less hangouts that can be redeemed in other social hangout locations. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>ideation&mdash;</h3>
                    <p class="project-summary">
                        We landed on the problem space of wanting to improve social interactions by removing phone use pretty early on, but we also wanted to explore different ways of intervening. Each of member of our team listed out ten different ideas that would speak to solving this issue. Through the process of elimination, narrowed down to two of the ideas that seemed the most fitting for our goals and time frame.

                                <li>
                                    Start people off with coupons, later when they’re hooked ask if they would be interested donating instead 
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Combat “conversational narcissism” by taking in a person’s info (harmless) and outputting it to the person they’re hanging out with using hypothetical questions (“What has John been up to recently?”)</li>
                            <li>
                                Create a mobile application that promotes spending better quality time with friends by using bets. Within a friend group, every individual places a bet of any amount. The first person to touch and start using their phone loses the bet and the money he placed down. The remaining money is split between the rest of the participants.
                            </li>

                        <u>Final idea</u><br/>
                        From looking at other precedents, research, and receiving additional feedback from our peers, we decided to continue with the first idea. Users would receive points from not using their phones which they can later redeem. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>research&mdash;</h3>
                    <p class="project-summary">

                    <h3>proof of concept&mdash;</h3>
                    <p class="project-summary">
                        We conducted a series of studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our idea. To do this, we observed the behavior of friends in groups and presented them with a scenario similar to our concept. Our subjects were told to stay off their phones during the duration of the hangout. If they were successfully able to do so, then they would be rewarded with some incentive of their choice. In this case, participants were offered a free bubble tea drink if they successfully completed the hangout. Out of our 6 participants, 4 were successful. The two that did not complete the challenge forgot about the challenge and checked their phones out of habit. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        <u>Takeaway</u><br/>
                        Incentives like free bubble tea kept participants motivated to not check their phones
                        Having the reward dependant on another participant kept the participants accountable.

                    <h3>storyboarding &amp; userflow&mdash;</h3>
                    <p class="project-summary">
                        After solidifying our concept, we started to storyboard out exactly what features of the app would be necessary. We looked at apps with similar goals like “Pocket Points” as references to how the user experience was designed.

                        We then created paper wireframes and drew out the possible user paths.
